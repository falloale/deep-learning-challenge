# deep-learning-challenge - Report

## Overview: From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. I've used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Data Processing
